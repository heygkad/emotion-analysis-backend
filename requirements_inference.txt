# Requirements for local inference only
# For training, use requirements.txt instead

# Core TensorFlow (same version as training)
tensorflow-macos>=2.15.0
tensorflow-metal>=1.1.0

# For loading the label encoder
joblib>=1.3.0

# NumPy is included with TensorFlow, but listed for clarity
numpy>=1.24.0

# Note: You don't need these for inference:
# - pandas (only needed for loading datasets)
# - scikit-learn (only needed for train_test_split, LabelEncoder - but we save the encoder)
# - huggingface-hub (only needed for loading datasets)
# - pyarrow (only needed for parquet files)
# - flask (only needed for API hosting)
# - flask-cors (only needed for API hosting)
